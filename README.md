## Broadcast over IP using only Winsock Control


</div>

### Description

Allows applications to broadcast messages to all computers on a network only using the standard MS Winsock control. This very simple procedure allows all computers to receive the data in a short space of time, making it very useful for chat applications etc.

To broadcast using the Winsock Control, set the protocol to UDP and the remote IP to 255.255.255.255. Any program set to receive UDP data on the remote port set will receive the data. Its that simple. I have included a sample application to demonstrate.
