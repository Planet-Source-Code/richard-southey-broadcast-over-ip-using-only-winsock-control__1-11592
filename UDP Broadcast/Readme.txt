This is a sample broadcasting system.

It uses only a MS Winsock Control set to use
UDP and an RemoteHost of 255.255.255.255.

I tested this system using a Direct Cable Connection
between to PCs, on using Win98 the other Win95c.
It is set up so it uses TCP/IP as the protocol so
each PC has its own IP address.

The system works for me on this arrangement.
The only thing that happens is sometimes the sending
program does not receive its own data, but sometimes it does :(

I hope this is useful.
